### Hello!
My name is Claire, welcome to my webpage. I am an ecologist with experience in marine, estuarine, and terrestrial ecosystems. I lead field teams, design research projects, do data analysis, and write reports and papers. I am especially interested in climate change and disturbance impacts on species traits, species composition, and ecosystem function.
